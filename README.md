# Markdown-renderer
An application that renders markdown reports from S3 client-side.

Features:
1. Markdown renderer
2. Report browser
3. Auth to ensure you can only view reports that belong to a group of users.
4. Routing to create links to directly access reports

## Overall product proposal
Product: An automated, scheduled, hosted static data Jupyter Notebook based reporting app.
User: Data analysts and scientists with limited Cloud infrastructure knowledge.

1. Marketing landing website.
1. Provide (Python) API to build report in notebook and upload to static storage finished report.
2. Provide a Jupyter notebook via CLI with requirements.txt.
3. Schedule notebook execution via CLI.
4. Provide access controlled reports via browser.

Have an open public example of auto-generated reports.

Asset structure:
1. Public/private
2. Account
3. Topic
4. Title

Can restrict users within one account to certain topics.

Design components to be open-source and provide paid hosted solution.

Deliverables:
1. Create static reporting example using public dataset.
   1. What dataset would make interesting reports which is updated real-time?

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
